Baseball Project - Daily wOBA Tracker

wOBA is "Weighted On Base Average", this is perhaps the most telling statistic to measure a player's overall offensive contribution per plate appearance
More info can be found here: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOBA)

For now, this project will focus on tracking stats for the New York Mets (Because GOOOOOO METSSSSSS!!!) but will eventually expand this tool so that it'll spit out a daily report for all of the other teams.

The purpose of this project is to track individual player stats of the Mets, give an overall wOBA for the Mets as a whole, and expand this tool with other useful statistics that would be very good to know. I hope to not only improve my python skills, but also to improve my familiarity with Git/Github and most importantly, further improve my understanding of the wonderful sport known as Baseball.
