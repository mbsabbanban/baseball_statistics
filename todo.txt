Need to do by the end of the week

(1) QA all the scripts to have an idea of what each piece in the project is doing [done]
(2) Need to get the rawdata_stat_get.py up and running so MySQL data accessible from anywhere [done]
(3) Set-up a cron job so that the local job runs everyday [not working, need to take another look]
(4) Need to download the previous 10 years of lahman database and have the data accessible from anywhere
